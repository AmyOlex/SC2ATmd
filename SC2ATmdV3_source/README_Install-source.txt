SC2ATmd v3:  Standard and Consensus Clustering Analysis Tool for Microarray Data v3

To run SC2ATmd you must have a fully licensed version of MATLAB AND the Bioinformatics Toolbox by MathWorks Inc. installed on your computer.  

The Matlab distribution of SC2ATmd will run under any OS that supports MATLAB.


To Install:

1 - unzip all files into the same folder in your Matlab working directory.

2 - make sure the search path in Matlab includes the new folder.  To do this type 'path' in the MATLAB command window and press enter.  If the new folder is not present you need to add it.  This can be done on the command line with the 'addpath' command, or using the path tool by typing 'pathtool' in the command window.  See MATLAB documentation for details on these commands.



To Run:

To run the SC2ATmd GUI type 'SC2ATmd' exactly as written (case sensistive) in the MATLAB command window.

More advanced MATLAB users may explore and use the m-files directly.
